#Doubly linked list.
This is a data structure that contain nodes which hold data, a pointer to the previous node, and another pointer to the next node.
Doubly linked list is similar to the singly linked list but the only difference is each node holds two pointers (Prev and Next)
Doubly linked list also have the head to be a node which have the prev pointer pointing to null.
